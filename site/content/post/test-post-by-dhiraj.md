# This is pretty darn cool.

We’re using a React.JS app to do WYSIWYG editing of a blog post that will be saved to GitHub as a file committed into a git repository, but in *draft* state.

Basic formatting** is available**. 

Image addition is also working.

Of course, editing is rudimentary, but code view is available for full markdown editing!
